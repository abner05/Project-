Lab 5: How to setup a new Jenkins Server in VM

        Jenkins is a free and open-source automation server that connects with a variety of AWS Services, including AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeDeploy, Amazon EC2 Spot,    and Amazon EC2 Fleet. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) can be used to quickly launch a Jenkins application on AWS.

        This Activity guide walks you through the process of deploying a Jenkins application. You will launch an EC2 instance, install Jenkins on that instance, and configure Jenkins to automatically spin up Jenkins build slave instances if build abilities need to be augmented on the instance.


Lab 6: How to setup a new project in Jenkins to pull the code from GitHub

        Jenkins is the most famous CI/CD tool in the DevOps era. We already know that Jenkins can be integrated with version control tools, build tools, continuous integration tools, configuration management tools, and so on. So, let’s get started with Jenkins integration with one of the most common version control tools, Git.

        We will learn about Jenkins GitHub Integration in this guide.


Lab 7: How to setup the CICD with Git, Maven, artifacts

        Maven is a prominent open-source build tool created by the Apache Group that allows you to build, publish, and deploy several projects at the same time for improved project management. The tool enables developers to create and document the lifecycle framework.

        As we discussed above, Jenkins is the most famous CI/CD tool. In this Activity guide, we will be learning how we can deploy an application using Jenkins, Maven, and Git.


Lab 8: How to setup the CICD with Apache tomcat for java applications.

Apache Tomcat is a Java servlet container that is open source that implements various Java Enterprise Specs, including the Websites API, Java-Server Pages, and, lastly, the Java Servlet.

It started out as the reference implementation for the initial Java-Server Pages and Java Servlet API. It is still one of the most extensively used java servers due to features such as high extensibility, a solid core engine, and a well-tested and durable design.

We used the term “servlet” several times in this article; what is a java servlet? It is a type of software that allows the webserver to process dynamic (java-based) content utilizing HTTP protocols.

In this Activity guide, we cover How to set up the CI/CD with Apache tomcat for java applications.



Lab 9: How to install Docker in VM

Docker is an open platform for app development, shipping, and running. Docker allows you to decouple your apps from your infrastructure, allowing you to release software more quickly. Docker allows you to manage your infrastructure in the same manner that you control your applications. You may drastically minimize the time between writing code and executing it in production by utilizing Docker’s methodology for fast shipping, testing, and deploying code.

Docker is available for download and installation on Windows Os, Linux, and macOS.

To know how to install docker on your machine read our blog on Docker Installation.





Lab 10: Working With Docker Images



Docker images serve as a template for creating a Docker container. Images are read-only templates that provide Docker container creation instructions. A Docker image is a multi-layered file that is used to execute code in a Docker container.

In this Activity guide, we cover how to Create/Push an Image, how to Tag images, Inspect Image details, Listing out Images, Delete Images from Local repo.

Read our blog to get an idea of Docker Image







Lab 11: Work on containers and execute some commands inside it





A Docker container is a runnable version of an image. Containers can be built, started, stopped, paused, and removed using the Docker API and CLI. You can attach storage to a container, connect it to one or more networks, and even create a new image based on its existing state.

This Activity guide covers how to create/delete a container, the container’s lifecycle, inspecting container details, listing containers, and executing inside a container.
Lab 12: How to install Ansible in VM



Ansible is a software program that provides cross-platform computer assistance through simple yet effective automation. It is primarily aimed at IT professionals, who use it for application deployment, workstation and server updates, cloud provisioning, configuration management, intra-service orchestration, and practically anything else that a systems administrator does on a weekly or daily basis. Ansible does not rely on agent software and does not require any additional security infrastructure, making it simple to set up.

In this Lab, you will learn how to install Ansible on AWS EC2 Linux Instance (VM) and check the Ansible version. You can create and configure the Ansible locally on your own Linux VM or your Linux Machine.

AWS is in demand with Ansible in the Industry, and for this reason, we are working on AWS Cloud for configuring Ansible.




Lab 13: How to setup the inventory of Ansible

Ansible runs on many systems in your infrastructure simultaneously. It does it by picking portions of Ansible’s inventory file systems, which defaults to being stored in the location /etc/ansible/hosts. You can define a different inventory file using the -i <path>option on the command line.

In this activity guide, we will set up an Ansible controller that communicates with 2 target machines.

We will also configure inventory files and run commands to test if our configuration is working.






Lab 14: How to run the ansible Ahdoc commands
        
        
        
        Ansible ad hoc commands are one-liners composed to perform a particular task, like performing a quick task over various machines.

In this Lab, we will learn how to use Ad-hoc commands in Ansible Playbook.
        
        
        

Lab 15: How to run a playbook in Ansible
        
        
        Playbooks register and perform Ansible’s configuration, deployment, and orchestration functions. They can specify a policy you want your remote systems to implement or a set of actions in a standard IT process.

Modules are script-like programs written to specify the desired state of the system. A code editor is used to write Modules. Modules are written by the developer and executed via SSH. Modules are part of a more extensive program called Playbook. Ansible module is a standalone script that is used inside an Ansible Playbook.

Here, you’ll learn how to create an Ansible Playbook from Scratch and test the same playbook.
